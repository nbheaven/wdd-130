        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Main purpose:
This website will serve as a more modern and convenient way of acquiring and keeping customers in a world where how we interact and make purchases is changing rapidly. Most auto detailers either work independently, or for a local small business. Most of these businesses rely on potential customers calling to schedule an appointment, then waiting for an employee to come out and give them a quote, then potentially more waiting if the job isn't done that day. People today move quickly and by providing a website that is well organized and easy to book an appointment on Chestermere Detailers will have a large leg up on competing businesses.

Home page:
This website will have a home page that will greet customers with brief descriptions of the services offered and information on what separates us from the competition. The home page will also feature images showing: people working in a shop environment, freshly detailed cars, before and afters of cars worked on. The home page will feature small amounts of information to spark user interest, and will also have links to two separate pages; book now, and contact us, both in the nav bar, and at appropriate places in the body of the page.

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

        <img src="#" alt="image for homepage">

      </ul>
      <h3>Book now</h3>
      <p>
        Book now page:
The book now page will feature all of the packages and plans that are offered, and provide a way to quickly and easily schedule an appointment. The packages will be split up into three tiers for both the exterior and interior. The first tier will take the most time and will offer all of the services available for a premium price. The second tier will offer most of the same services as the first, with some of the more labor and cost heavy services withheld to provide a lower price. Some of these withheld services can include uv resistant coatings for interior trim items and full textile shampooing on the interior and services link undercarriage cleaning and rust protection of the exterior. This second tier will be positioned as the best value as even though it offers slightly less than the top package it will have a lower price, while still covering most of the desired services. The third tier will offer a budget offering for cost conscious customers. This package will go without some key items like odor removal and steam cleaning to fix sticky or soft buttons but will allow some customers to still find a service that matches their budget while upselling the second tier to others.

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact us</h3>
      <p>
        Contact us page:
The contact us page will offer information on the office location, phone number, and email of the business. It will also have the office hours listed. This page will feature all of the general information about the company and provide a way for potential customers to ask general questions about the business. As well as general inquiries this page will offer a place for users to ask more specific questions about their car and what services or packages will work best for them.

Final information:
By providing all of the information about booking, prices, and services offered in one well organized and professional looking website, Chestermere Detailers will have a much more compelling offer than most of the competitors. Auto detailing is a business where most companies can offer pretty much the same services so perceived value means a lot. By having a better looking website and an easier way to make appointments we will shorten the amount of time it takes to acquire customers and provide a competitive edge when compared to most small businesses with no website, or an old one and a much longer period of time to acquire customers.
